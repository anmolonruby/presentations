# Maps

With @veltman at NICAR 2014.

Digital journalism is different beyond just being newer and shinier and more
interactive. The balance of power between writer and reader shifts: with
interactivity, you can present something where people learn more after they're
done with the last word or the first few clicks.

Maps fell easily into this paradigm because they are are clearly linked to the
world and naturally multiscale: 'normal' webmaps have the futuristic ability
to talk on worldwide, national, local, and inch scales.

But they're tricky. Even more than other forms of visualization, mapmaking
is filled with rules and critics, foretelling certain death if you dare
forget the MAUP theorem. Don't worry, we'll get to that in a second.

Instead of castigating you for mistakes you haven't made yet, let's look at a few
principles.

rule to remember is: **absolute and relative values are different**: keep
in mind which you're dealing with in each situation.

## Interaction

Maps are heavily interactive: here's how to make them intuitive and avoid
the scroll monster.
